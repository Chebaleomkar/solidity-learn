# 🚀 Solidity Learning Journey  

Welcome to my Solidity learning repository! Here, I'm documenting my progress as I learn Solidity from **beginner to advanced**.  

## 📌 What is Solidity?  
[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) is a **smart contract programming language** for the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to create decentralized applications (DApps) and execute transactions on Ethereum.  

## 📚 Learning Path  
I'm starting from the basics and progressing step by step:  

### 1️⃣ Introduction to Solidity  
- What is Solidity?  
- Setting up the development environment  
- Writing and deploying a simple smart contract  

### 2️⃣ Solidity Basics  
- Variables & Data Types  
- Functions & Visibility  
- Conditionals & Loops  

### 3️⃣ Intermediate Concepts  
- Smart contract structure  
- Storage vs. Memory  
- Mappings & Structs  

### 4️⃣ Advanced Solidity  
- Inheritance & Modifiers  
- Events & Error Handling  
- Gas Optimization Techniques  

## 🛠 Tools & Resources  
- **IDE**: [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) & [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- **Blockchain**: [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)  
- **Testing**: Hardhat & Truffle  
- **Learning Resources**: Solidity Docs, CryptoZombies, YouTube tutorials :https://youtu.be/AYpftDFiIgk?si=jDEX_dFjGbNVfgvZ
